<!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about" class="glass-section">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate and detail-oriented Software Developer with 2 years of professional experience in designing and developing scalable web applications. During my tenure at Maharashtra Knowledge Corporation Ltd., I worked on building responsive user interfaces, integrating REST APIs, and enhancing application performance across multiple modules.

My technical expertise includes Golang, Java, React, Vue.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and MongoDB. I create clean and modern UI designs using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, and ShadCN UI. I am comfortable working in both Linux and Windows environments and regularly use Git and Postman for version control, collaboration, and API testing.

I enjoy solving complex problems, optimizing system performance, and continuously learning new technologies to stay aligned with industry standards. My goal is to build efficient, scalable, and user-centric digital solutions that create real business impact.
